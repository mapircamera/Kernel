###Capture Modes
    Kernel supports five separate capture modes: Single Photo, Continuous Photo, Burst Photo, Video, and Looping Video.
    
####Single Photo
    Single photo, as the name implies, captures one image per trigger signal.
    
####Continuous Photo
    Continuous photo mode begins capturing images as fast as possible on a trigger signal and continues until the camera receives a stop signal.
