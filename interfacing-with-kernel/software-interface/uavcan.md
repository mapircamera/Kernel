#UAVCAN

UAVCAN is a lightweight protocol designed for reliable communication in aerospace and robotic applications via CAN bus.  Please browse the [UAVCAN.org](http://uavcan.org/) website for more information.

* Democratic network - no single point of failure.  
* Publish/subscribe or request/response exchange semantics.  
* Allows efficient exchange of large data structures.  
* Lightweight, easy to implement protocol.  
* Supports network-wide time synchronization with microsecond precision.  
* Doubly- or triply- redundant CAN bus.  
* Can be used in deeply embedded, resource constrained, hard real-time systems.  
* The specification and high quality reference implementations are open and free to use (MIT License).
