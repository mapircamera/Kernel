# Installation

## Installation

Download the package for your OS below, extract, and run the MAPIR\_Camera\_Control program from within the extracted folder.

### Windows

[DOWNLOAD HERE](https://github.com/mapircamera/MAPIR_Camera_Control/blob/master/Packages/Windows/README.md)

_If you run into a "No module named gdal" error when installing or running, it's because the osgeo packages list name the \_gdal.pyd file "\_gdal.&lt;version info&gt;.pyd" rename the file to "\_\_gdal.pyd" and it should work fine._

## Launching MAPIR Camera Control

Double click the application to launch the program.

It will take some time for the application to launch. Faster computers allow the application to start more quickly.
