### GPS Time:

Global Positioning System time, is the atomic time scale implemented by the atomic clocks in the GPS ground control stations and the GPS satellites themselves. GPS time was zero at 0h 6-Jan-1980 and since it is not perturbed by leap seconds GPS is now ahead of UTC by 18 seconds \(as of January 2018\).

### UTC Time:

Coordinated Universal Time, popularly known as GMT \(Greenwich Mean Time\), or Zulu time. Local time differs from UTC by the number of hours of your timezone.

### Local \(System\) Time:

The date/time reported by your computer \(as seen by your web browser\). If your PC clock is accurate to a second then the other time scales displayed above will also be accurate to within one second.
