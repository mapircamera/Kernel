#Video Output

Each Kernel camera can output HDMI video, SD (DAC) video, or both. Changing the value in the "Video Output" drop-down will change the setting for the selected camera.

If you have multiple cameras connected in an array, only the master camera can output HDMI. Both can output SD but not at the same time. We recommend setting all cameras to HDMI in order to use the live video frames for auto exposure calculations.
