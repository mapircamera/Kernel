#MCC: MAPIR Camera Control Application

Our MAPIR Camera Control (MCC) software is what you'll use to interact with Kernel, as well as process images. In the following sections, we'll go over how to use the interface we've designed and also show the code behind the scenes for those that need lighter weight scripts or want to control our cameras from their own application.
