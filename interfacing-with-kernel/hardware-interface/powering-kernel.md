# Power Requirements

Each Kernel camera module requires a measured peak 790mA of power at 5VDC. When in doubt, please provide 5V1A **for each Kernel you are using**. Please see below for the typical total power requirements based on the number of cameras in your array.

| Number of Cameras | Required Power \(IDLE\) | Required Power \(PEAK\) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | 460mA | 790mA |
| 2 | 920mA | 1.58A |
| 3 | 1.38A | 2.37A |
| 4 | 1.84A | 3.16A |
| 5 | 2.30A | 3.95A |
