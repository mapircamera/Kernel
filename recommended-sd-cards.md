#Recommended microSD Storage for Kernel Cameras

Kernel cameras were designed to allow for max continuous RAW image capture. To allow for these capture speeds it is important to use a memory card capable of keeping up with the required write speeds. While any microSD card up to 128GB can be used, we recommended the ones tested below for optimal results:

| Card Capacity | Card Brand | Card Model Number                      | Kernel Sensor | Kernel Image Mode | Photos Per Second | Comments |
|---------------|------------|----------------------------------------|---------------|-------------------|-------------------|----------|
| 64GB          | Lexar      | 1000x                                  | 1.2MP         | .mapir (RAW)      |  3.50             |          |
| 64GB          | Lexar      | 1000x                                  | 1.2MP         | TIFF              |                   |          |

###How We Test Capture Speeds

We put the camera in the configuration and image mode listed above with a formatted SD card. We then capture 1000 photos and divide by the time it takes to capture them to determine the photos per second (fps).
