#Recommended microSD Storage for Kernel Cameras

Kernel cameras were designed to allow for max continuous RAW image capture. To allow for these capture speeds it is important to use a memory card capable of keeping up with the required write speeds. While any microSD card up to 128GB can be used, we recommended the ones tested below for optimal results:

| Card Capacity | Card Brand | Card Model Number | Kernel Sensor | Kernel Image Mode | Photos Per Second | Comments |
|---------------|------------|-------------------|---------------|-------------------|-------------------|----------|
| 64GB          |            |                   |               |                   |                   |          |
