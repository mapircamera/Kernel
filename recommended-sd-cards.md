#Recommended microSD Storage for Kernel Cameras

Kernel cameras were designed to allow for max continuous RAW image capture. To allow for these capture speeds it is important to use a memory card capable of keeping up with the required write speeds. While any microSD card up to 128GB can be used, we recommended the ones tested below for optimal results:

| Card Capacity | Card Brand | Card Model Number                      | Kernel Sensor | Kernel Image Mode | Photos Per Second | Image Size | Card Capacity | Card Capture Length |
|---------------|------------|----------------------------------------|---------------|-------------------|-------------------|------------|---------------|---------------------|
      |
| 128GB         | SanDisk    | Extreme 90MB/s SDSQXVF-128G-GN6MA      | 1.2MP         | MAPIR (RAW)       | **8.27fps**       | 1.75MB     | ~68,000 photos| 3 hours 10 minutes  |
| 128GB         | SanDisk    | Extreme 90MB/s SDSQXVF-128G-GN6MA      | 1.2MP         | TIFF              | **5.76fps**       | 2.34MB     | ~50,854 photos| 3 hours 49 minutes  |
| 64GB          | SanDisk    | Extreme 90MB/s SDSQXVF-064G-GN6MA      | 1.2MP         | MAPIR (RAW)      | **9.36fps**              | 1.75MB     | ~34,057 photos|3 hours 49 minutes |
| 64GB          | SanDisk    | Extreme 90MB/s SDSQXVF-064G-GN6MA      | 1.2MP         | TIFF                    | **5.54fps**              | 1.75MB     | ~34,057 photos|3 hours 49 minutes |








###How We Test Capture Speeds

We put the camera in the image mode listed above with a formatted SD card. We then capture 1000+ photos and divide by the time it takes to capture them to determine the photos per second (fps).
