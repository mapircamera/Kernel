#Kernel Filter Installation

Each filter should come with a small, flat, black, metal key, which is used to install and remove the filter.

##Removing a Kernel Filter

Unscrew the 4 screws holding the top yellow lens mount (the metal part the lens is threaded into).

Turn the lens mount over to reveal the filter.

Using the black key, use the two knubs and insert them into the two holes on the filter.

Turn the filter counter-clockwise to unthread it. Be very careful to apply a lite pressure to the filter such that the knubs stay in the holes and you don't accidentally scratch the filter with the key.
