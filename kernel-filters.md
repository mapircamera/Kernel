| F                 | RGB                     |                |                          |                    |              |









##Top Lens Protector

The clear glass lens protector on Kernel provides a sealed, abrasion resistant aperture. You can thread additional filters on top of the LP but do not suggest it due to increased vignetting that may result.

Clear Aperture: 18.5mm
Filter Mount Thickness: 7.0mm
Filter Glass Thickness: 1.0mm
Mount Material: Black Anodized Aluminum

Useful Transmission Range: 350-1100nm
Cut-on Wavelength 50% Transmission: 330nm
Tolerance: +/- 10nm
Peak Transmission: >90%
Surface Quality: 40/20
