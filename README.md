# Introduction

## This guide provides an in depth look at the Kernel camera product line.

#### Kernel is the first truly modular camera system capable of customized camera arrays. Using the Kernel link boards arrays can be built in both linear and curved orientation. Each Kernel camera is also highly customizable and expandable, allowing the user to adjust the lens, filter and sensor as desired. The open 40pin Kernel I/O port allows easy interfacing with each camera or camera array, and its 60pin bottom expansion port allows additional features to be added in the future.
